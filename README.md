Healcode Summer Reading List
============================

List of good websites:
* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)
* [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/)
* [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/)

In the effort of preparing ourselves for future widget improvments & being better with new web technologies in general, here's a list of helpful resources.  Tackling these in the order presented allows you to build on the knowledge from previous steps.  Do at least one small exercise per day to keep it fresh.  There's an additional list of references at the bottom of this page.

Step 1:
-------

Sign up for [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/). It's free.

Step 2: Programming fundamentals (and some basic Javascript)
------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've signed up for Codecademy, I recommend doing the [Javascript path](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) first.  This will teach you both JS and some good programming fundamentals to use in any modern browser.

Step 3: Web Fundamentals (HTML & CSS)
-------------------------------------

Do the [HTML & CSS track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) next, even if you think you know everything about HTML & CSS, because no one really does.

If you learn better through videos, [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) may be helpful.

Step 4: Learn How To Use Dev Tools in the Browser
-------------------------------------------------

Codeschool has a [free tutorial](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/) for Dev Tools to diagnose/debug anything that happens in the browser.  EVERYONE SHOULD DO THIS.
